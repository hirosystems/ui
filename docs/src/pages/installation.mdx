# Getting Started

Stacks UI is a React component library built for use within the Stacks ecosystem. It uses [emotion v11](https://emotion.sh)
and [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com) under the hood for building complex, accessible UI components.

## Installation

-> Note: we use `yarn`, but you can also use `npm`

First, make sure to install `emotion` and its babel plugin:

```bash
yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/react @emotion/babel-plugin
```

Then, install `@stacks/ui`:

```bash
yarn add @stacks/ui @stacks/ui-core @stacks/ui-theme
```

### With next.js

If you're using `@stacks/ui` with next.js, make sure to check out the
[with emotion example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-emotion-11) to correctly
use emotion in a SSR environment. You can also look at the source code for this docs site, as it's using next.js.

## Usage

To use any component from `@stacks/ui`, we need to import the `ThemeProvider` into the root component of the app that
will be using Stacks UI. The ThemeProvider creates a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) scope
for all of our components to use.

```tsx
// app.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@stacks/ui';

<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
```

### Reset global styles

Typically you will want to apply a css reset to your page. `@stacks/ui` exports
a [`CSSReset`](/components/css-reset) that will reset and improve the browsers default styles. It's heavily inspired by
[Tailwind's preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.1.2/dist/base.css).

```tsx
const App({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <CSSReset />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Using components

Simply import components by name from the `@stacks/ui` package, as shown
below.

```js
import { Button } from '@stacks/ui';
```
