# CSS Reset

CSS Reset is an opinionated css normalizer heavily inspired by [Tailwind's preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.1.2/dist/base.css),
which is based off of the ever famous [`normalize.css`](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) by Nicolas Gallagher.

## Import

```tsx
import { CSSReset } from '@stacks/ui';
```

## Usage

This component must be used within the theme provider, typically within some kind of `AppWrapper` or within an `_app.tsx` component.

```tsx
const AppWrapper = ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <CSSReset />
    {children}
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
